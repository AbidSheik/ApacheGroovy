// Public fields are turned into properties automatically, which results in less verbose code, without so many getter and setter methods. 
// More on this aspect will be covered in the fields and properties section.

// Their declarations and any property or method without an access modifier are public.

// Classes do not need to have the same name of the files where they are defined. It is not a requirement but a convention that is recommended is to capitalize the first letter of the class name.

//One file may contain one or more classes (but if a file contains no classes, it is considered a script).
